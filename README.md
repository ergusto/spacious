# Spacious

> A set of functional CSS utilities for all your spacing needs. 

Padding and margin utilities formed on a ratio of your base font size. Classes follow a simple pattern of `{viewport}-{spacing-direction}{spacing-amount}`.

For example:

```html
<p class='ml2 mbs-ml3' />
```

Translates to `margin-left-2` and `mobile-small-margin-left-3`.
